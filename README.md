# CyberSecurityDocs
Repository to store personal documents relating to Cyber Security, including pen testing reports and CTF writeups.

"F4rmc0rp Report" is the final report I wrote up during my Intro to Penetration Testing course at the University of Florida. This course-defined Penetration Testing report includes information from over 20 exercises that were completed throughout the fall semester of 2020. Each of these exercises had students utilize common cyber security tactics and tools to solve problems and find keys. "F4rmc0rp" refers to the fictional organization that students enlisted by to find vulnerabilities. "Pr0b3" is the name of the fictional security company that students belonged to.
